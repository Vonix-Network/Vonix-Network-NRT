## 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

### 1. **Forum Moderation Routes** ✅
**Problem:** Server wouldn't start due to missing `verifyToken` import  
**Fix:** Added `verifyToken` to imports in `server/routes/forum-moderation.js`

### 2. **Negative Forum Counts** ✅
**Problem:** Deleting posts caused negative topic/post counts (-1, -2, etc.)  
**Fix:** Added `MAX(0, ...)` protection in all deletion operations
- Fixed in `forum-core.js` and `forum-moderation.js`
- Created database repair script to fix existing negative counts

### 3. **Leaderboard Profile Links** ✅
**Problem:** Clicking users on leaderboard went to homepage  
**Fix:** Changed links from `/profile/:id` to `/users/:id` to match correct route

### 4. **Last Post Timestamps** ✅
**Problem:** Forums showed "Just now" instead of actual timestamps  
**Fix:** 
- Added `last_post_time` to forum query
- Created script to refresh all stale last post data
- Fixed post deletion to properly update forum last post info
